### Requirements

- Python 3.8

- torch

- numpy

- pandas

- catboost 

- sklearn

- PyEMD

- xgboost

- scipy

- fastdtw

  

### Data Preparation

In the "datasets" directory, you can find pre-processed files for three datasets, including the training, validation, and test sets, as well as the raw files for the datasets. You can choose to process these raw files according to your requirements. We also provide adjacency matrices based on neighboring relationships for each dataset, as some models require this information.



### Training

- Before using the GCN-GRU or HGCN models, you need to adjust the hyperparameter 'is_graph_based = Ture' in the main.py file.
- You can run any model except for the Cat-RF-LSTM and CEEMDAN-XGBoost models directly from the main file, simply by changing the model name, such as:

```python
model = AGCRN(input_dim, num_nodes, horizon, batch_size, seq_len,device)
```

- Training command:

```python
python main.py
```

- The Cat-RF-LSTM and CEEMDAN-XGBoost models do not use the typical deep learning training methods but are trained in stages in their respective folders under the "Lane_level_models" directory.
